# Items and Inventory System

This project showcases a dynamic **Items and Inventory System** designed for an immersive gaming experience. It features a **Scriptable Object-based inventory system** with item categories, a custom editor for scalability, and intuitive UI elements such as tabs, toggles, scroll views, and a 3D preview display. Players can interact with a game world, collect and manage items, and use a functional weapon system with ammunition.
